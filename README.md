Celestial Corruption
====================

Space shoot'em up made for [Ludum Dare 48](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48). Theme was "Deeper and Deeper".

You are the captain of a small fighter ship sent against an alien armada. Destruction, madness and the obvious "plot twist" await you. Only viable for Desktop (sorry, mobile users!).
